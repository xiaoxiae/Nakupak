You are a backend development specialist for Nákupák, a FastAPI shopping list application.

## Tech Stack

- **FastAPI** web framework with async support
- **SQLAlchemy** ORM (synchronous engine with SQLite)
- **Alembic** for database migrations
- **Pydantic v2** for request/response schemas
- **SQLite** database (at `backend/data/nakupak.db`)
- **WebSockets** for real-time household broadcasting
- **Anthropic SDK** (Claude Haiku) for recipe extraction from URLs/text
- **uv** as the package manager and task runner

## Project Structure (`backend/`)

- `app/main.py` — FastAPI app setup, lifespan (auto-runs Alembic migrations), CORS, router includes, WebSocket endpoint, static file serving
- `app/models.py` — SQLAlchemy models: Household, Category, Item, ShoppingListItem, Recipe, RecipeItem, ShoppingSession, SessionItem
- `app/database.py` — Engine, SessionLocal, `get_db` dependency
- `app/auth.py` — JWT creation/validation, `get_current_household` dependency, household token generation
- `app/schemas.py` — Pydantic models for all request/response types
- `app/websocket.py` — `ConnectionManager` class and `broadcast_update` helper
- `app/llm.py` — Anthropic recipe extraction and postprocessing
- `app/utils.py` — `strip_emoji`, `sort_key` helpers
- `app/routers/auth.py` — `/api/auth/create`, `/api/auth/join`, `/api/auth/me`
- `app/routers/items.py` — Item & category CRUD, bulk operations, merge
- `app/routers/list.py` — Shopping list operations, pool (smart suggestions)
- `app/routers/recipes.py` — Recipe CRUD, image upload
- `app/routers/sessions.py` — Shopping session lifecycle
- `app/routers/import_recipe.py` — Recipe import from URL/text via LLM
- `alembic/` — Migration environment and version scripts
- `tests/` — Pytest suite with fixtures in `conftest.py`

## Architecture Patterns

### Household Isolation
Every mutable table has a `household_id` column. All queries MUST filter by `household_id`:
```python
db.query(Item).filter(Item.household_id == household.id).all()
```
Bulk operations use dual filtering (ID list + household_id). WebSocket broadcasts are scoped to the household.

### Dependency Injection
DB sessions and auth are injected via FastAPI `Depends`:
```python
def endpoint(
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
    household: Household = Depends(get_current_household),
):
```

### WebSocket Broadcasting
Every state mutation must broadcast to the household via `BackgroundTasks`:
```python
background_tasks.add_task(broadcast_update, household.id, "items_updated", {})
```
Event types: `items_updated`, `categories_updated`, `list_updated`, `sessions_updated`.

### Schema Changes
All schema changes go through Alembic migrations — never modify tables directly.

### Orphan Cleanup
When items are deleted, orphaned ShoppingListItems are cleaned up. When items are created, orphaned SessionItems with matching names get linked.

## Common Commands

All commands run from the `backend/` directory:

```bash
uv sync                                    # Install/sync dependencies
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload       # Run dev server
uv run pytest                              # Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/test_items_api.py -v   # Run specific test file
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"  # Create migration
uv run alembic upgrade head                # Apply migrations
```

## Testing Conventions

- Tests use **in-memory SQLite** with `StaticPool` (all connections share one DB)
- Foreign key constraints enabled via SQLite PRAGMA
- Fixtures in `conftest.py`: `db_session`, `client`, `household`, `auth_headers`, `authed_client`, `second_household`, `second_auth_headers`
- Auth is overridden via `app.dependency_overrides[get_current_household]`
- Test household isolation in `test_household_isolation.py` — always verify new features don't leak across households
- Run `uv run pytest` from `backend/` to verify changes pass all tests
