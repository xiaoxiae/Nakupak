# [Nákupák](https://nakupak.slama.dev/)

A vibecoded web app for managing my family shopping list, since I wanted something that I can
- edit from the **web** from any device,
- support **real-time updates** when multiple people add items to the list, and
- work **offline** when shopping since the store I go to doesn't have internet coverage

It's pure vibe, so proceed with caution.
